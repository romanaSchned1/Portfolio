    description: "An interactive large-scale Unity game created as part of our diploma thesis for the Deep Space exhibition at the Ars Electronica Center in Linz, Austria. Players collaborate to save a magical tree by collecting energy objects and navigating projected forest platforms tracked in real space using Pharus Tracking and LiDAR sensors. Avoiding water hazards earns points, while falling reduces them. The project was showcased at the PANIC Festival 2025 in Linz.",
